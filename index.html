    <p>The evidence of climate change is all around us and its dire consequences cannot be ignored anymore, however, Computer Science can play a vital role in combating these challenges as it can not only in deliver tools for greater understanding of climate science but also reduce the environmental costs of computing [5]. Studies show that Information and Communications Technology (ICT) can enable a 20% reduction of global CO2 emissions by 2030. It is argued that all levels of education need to prepare students how to deal with these challenges during their careers [3] and there is an increasing but unmet need for science educators to develop such technologies in the fight with climate change [1]. However, the scale of action required to address it is inadequate [4] and research on sustainability computing is scarce within CS education research [5] and especially on students’ opinion on the matter. In order to respond to the gaps recognised in the literature review and to investigate students’ attitude on incorporating climate change topics in the Computer Science curriculum, this study entertains the idea of a revised Computer Science university curriculum; one that integrates significant sustainability and climate change issues at different levels and stages of the offered computing programmes.</p>

    <p> <ul>
      <li>Provide an insight into the connection between Computer Science education and climate change and highlight the impact and importance of using computing education to mitigate the causes and prevent a climate disaster.</li>
      <li>Provide an exploratory study of students’ awareness of climate change issues and investigate to what extent they have been exposed to such knowledge through their time before and during university and how their country of origin has helped shape their views.</li>
      <li>Provide an exploratory study of students’ opinions on incorporating sustainable and climate change topics in Computer Science curriculums at university level.</li>
      <li>Provide a suggestion on how to most effectively introduce and adapt climate change education to the current Computer Science curriculum in a way that is engaging to the students by incorporating topics which are requested by the students themselves.</li></ul></p>

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Methodology</span></h5>
    <p>With the intention of gauging the level of student interest and gaining an understanding of the potential effects of changes in curriculum, a literature review was conducted, and students enrolled at University of Aberdeen’s Computer Science degrees during the academic year prior to an altered curriculum were surveyed. The quantitative approach in the form of an online survey with 32 questions was complemented by a qualitative approach in the form of introducing open-ended questions to further analyse the data which offers an effective way of examining the data more in-depth. Questions were derived from common themes in the literature works and previously used techniques. The analysis of the survey results was conducted via explanatory sequential design [2] which involves first establishing a set of quantitative results, and then using the qualitative data to help clarify and understand those results. The results of the open-ended questions were analysed using thematic analysis.</p>

    <p> <ul>
      <li>The survey was completed by 41 University of Aberdeen Computer Science Students from 11 different countries, the majority of which are completing Single Honours Computing Science Degrees. Supporting the evidence found in the literature review, the majority of the surveyed students have a good awareness of climate change issues and believe climate change poses a very real threat but have not been taught climate change topics throughout their education so far (Fig. 1 & 2). Results from the survey also correspond to the findings from the literature review in terms of perceived misconceptions related to the causes of climate change and personal carbon footprint from PC usage. The study also found that their home countries have had a major impact on how students perceive climate change.</li>
      <li>A few students are not fully aware of the scale of a climate change disaster can have, do not think sustainability in computing is relevant to their degrees or believe that adding more topics would mean missing out on other important aspects of the degree. However, students realise their limited understanding of the issue and are interested in learning more through a carefully designed sustainability-based Computer Science curriculum (Fig. 3).</li>
      <li>The survey found that students are more interested in a sustainability issues included in an optional subject rather than a whole separate degree which led to the suggestion of introducing courses for introductory and upper-level levels.</li>
      <li>The courses could involve green computing topics such as: energy efficiency of ICT, reducing carbon footprint of computing, how to implement sustainability in ICT, recycling and reducing e-waste, etc., and include practical exercises in order to stimulate engagement and learning.</li></ul></p>

    <p>Taken together, the results of this study’s literature review and survey show what a positive impact climate science education can have on students in combating climate change; and indicate that there is a lot of evidence supporting the idea of adopting such a sustainability revised curriculum. Students believe introducing sustainable computing to the curriculum would entail a lot of advantages for them such as enhanced employability. The presence of a couple of misconceptions related to personal carbon footprint and the causes of climate change need to be considered as well when designing the curriculum. A suggestion on how to adopt such a curriculum was proposed by introducing an introductory and upper-level course based around green computing and climate informatics. The proposed topics to be included in those courses were determined by the relevant literature work and students’ interests. Future work could further explore in greater detail how these courses should be designed based on both teachers’ and students’ feedback. The insights gained from this study am to be of assistance to on how to best adapt the computer science university curriculum in a way that is both interesting to students and equipping them with the required skills to deal with the global challenges posed by climate change.</p>
